## ISEF Science Fair 2023 - Building AI Lip Reading Models

### Description
This is a Science Fair project aiming to build AIs that are able to read lips. This will be done by multiple mehtods which will be compared against each other for accuracy, speed, and readability. AI Models will be trained by by these models:  
    -**Brute Force**: the AI will be given hours of videos to train on and come up with its own conclusions on how to read lips. Its goal is both accuracy and speed, but it will probably get more caught up on a person's stutters/bad speech habits.  
    -**Human Based Model**: the AI will be trained to read lips more like a human focusing on getting the theme of the message over the exact words a person is saying. The AI will be given a word of context and told to put more emphasis on eyebrows, eyes, nose, etc. to get more of a gist of what a person is saying. Ideally, generative AI would be used to create these phrases and build text from the context given.
