# Science-Fair

This is a repository denoting my Science Fair Project for the 2023-2024 school year. The goal of this project is to create an AI that is able to read lips turning lip movements into text. Ideally, there would be two models where one is trained via brute force where the AI comes up with its own conclusions on how to read lips and another AI would be trained using a more human method where context will be givin and facial structure will be examined to guess what a person is saying. 

This is my first GitHub repo. I do not know how to structure it [yet]. When it is organized, it will follow a folder structure where the largest folders were be the two* AI models titled Brute Force and Influenced.

The project is currently in its fledgling stages. I am just learning how to use dlib to track facial movements.
